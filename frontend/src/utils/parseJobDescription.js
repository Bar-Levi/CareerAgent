    Revised Regex explanation:
    - (.*)                   => Capture everything (including newlines) before the footer block.
                                This will be our main description.
    - company:\s*([^,]+),   => After the literal "company:" (followed by optional spaces),
                                capture one or more characters that are not a comma. This is our company.
    - \s*company size:\s*([^,]+),  => After a comma and optional spaces, match "company size:" 
                                and capture the non-comma text for company size.
    - \s*company website:\s*(.*)$  => Finally, after a comma and optional spaces, match "company website:" 
                                and capture everything until the end (company website).
    
    We use the 'i' flag for case-insensitive matching.
